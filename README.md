# ML-projects
# This is a repository containing my mini-level projects.
In this repository, I have mini-level projects regarding ML algorithm.
The first project is Finding stroke with given data. The data given for stroke is in csv file format
The second project is finding whether the patient has breast cancer or not. The dataset is already present in python library. You can import it
The third project is about finding whether the given smartphone product is real or fake and it is decided according to phone specifications.
This third project is special to me as it is created for a DPBH(conducted by Indian government) project. This is for extension but I created this as single mini project as this ML model works with avg 99% accuracy.
You can use my projects for reference.
